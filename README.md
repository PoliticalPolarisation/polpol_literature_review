- Paez et al., (2012) - Interesting use of entropy to measure homogeneity at the neighbour level.
- Brown and Enos (2021) - Interesting the notion of relative exposure as the difference between the average spatial exposure of partisans within a geographic unit to the average spatial isolation of out-partisans also living in that geographic unit 
- Frias-Martinez (2012) - Example of Self-Organizing Map neural network for clustering tweets geographically
- carvalho et al., (2022) - This is exactly the k-means approach that I initially thought.
